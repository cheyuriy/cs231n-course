# Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition

## Spring 2018 assignments

Based on materials from [official course page](cs231n.github.io), [repository](https://github.com/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/tree/master/assignments/2018) and playlist with lectures [Stanford University CS231n, Spring 2017](|https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLC1qU-LWwrF64f4QKQT-Vg5Wr4qEE1Zxk).

### Notes

* Achieved 0.791 validation and 0.786 test accuracy in the second assignment.

* Used TensorFlow as a framework of choice (mostly due to too old GPU for PyTorch).

* In style transfer task decreased size of style image due to lack of a memory. It doesn't affect results.

### Configuration used

Video card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX680 (3Gb VRAM)
Driver version: 410.79
